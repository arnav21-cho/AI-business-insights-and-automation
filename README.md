# AI-business-insights-and-automation

## Project Overview
This project uses real-world business data to extract actionable insights and build a simple machine learning model that supports business decision-making.

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer and transaction-level data, including behavioral and demographic features, used to analyze patterns and predict key business outcomes.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to help a business make better decisions by:
- Identifying key factors that influence customer behavior
- Predicting an important business outcome using machine learning
- Automating part of the analysis so it can be reused on new data

## Tools & Techniques (planned)
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Data visualization (matplotlib / seaborn)
- Machine learning (basic supervised model)
- Simple automation script for repeatable insights
